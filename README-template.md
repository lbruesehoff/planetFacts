## Overview

### The challenge

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla Javascript
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

In this project I learned how to take wireframes made in AdodeXD and turn them into a live website that is mobile responsive.
I learned more about css grid, creating mobile and tablet view, and learning how to to diplsay different texts and images with Javascript.


### Continued development

In future development I would like to use React to help me build applications faster and more efficient. I still have to countine learning javscript to get a better understanding of React, but in the future I hope to be more comfortable with javascript.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - This helped me for learning vanilla javascript and css properties I did not fully understand. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand things I could not find in the official documents. I'd recommend it to anyone to look at stackover flow for problems you are stuck on.
